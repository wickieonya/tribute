        <h2>Here is a tribute of Steve Paul Job's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1955</strong> - Born in San Francisco, California, U.S.</li>
            <li><strong>1972</strong> - Attended Reed College where he studied calligraphy and arts before dropping out
                in the same year.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1974</strong> - Traveled through India seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.</li>
            <li><strong>1976</strong> - Co-founded Apple to sell Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - Developed the breakthrough Macintosh with inspiration from the Xerox Alto's
                mouse driven and graphical user interface.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1985</strong> - Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple, the company he had co-founded, after a long
                struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley.
                In this same year, Jobs took a few members of Apple to found NeXT, a computer platform development
                company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1986</strong> - Steve funded the computer graphics division of George Luca's Lucasfilm. The new
                company was Pixar and it produced the first 3D computer animated feature film <i>Toy Story (1995)</i>,
                and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 20 films since then.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1997</strong> - Apple acquired NeXT, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few
                months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Appl, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy.
                He worked closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural
                ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the <em>Think different</em> advertising campaign and leading the
                iMac, iTines, iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad.
            </li>
            <li><strong>2003</strong> - Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.</li>
            <li><strong>2011</strong> - Jobs died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at the age 56 on October 5,
                2011.
            </li>
        </ul>

                Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to
                become. Everything else is secondary.
